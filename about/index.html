			<p>My name is John Schulz, and I am a CIS major with a specialization in Systems Analysis and Integration at <a href="http://www.devry.edu" style="display: inline;">DeVry University</a>. I live in Plainfield with my wife, two cats and dog.</p>

			<p>Computers and electronic gadgetry have fascinated me since I was 6 years old when my father brought home my first computer, an Apple II. Despite having not spent my working career in this field, I always end up being the unofficial IT support regardless of my actual job. I mostly use Apple computers at home, but I do have Windows 7 installed on one of them, and a few years ago I hacked a little Dell netbook to run the Mac OS on it.</p>
			<p>Through my time at DeVry I've learned that I love programming, from my first C++ class to HTML/CSS and everything else. Unfortunately there are ver yfew pratical coding classes offered, and the majority of my time is spent taking superfluous classes. I realized that working at this pace didn't suit me. So I began seeking out other resources online, and found that while there are a few tutorials, I was swimming in an ocean of information with little more than a doggie-paddle. Aimlessly wandering through the chaos didn't feel like it would get me anywhere either. Then I discovered <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" style="display: inline;">Dev Bootcamp</a> and read that they were opening a branch in Chicago.</p>
			<p>Once I have finished my training at Dev Bootcamp, I will hopefully spend the following years as a software developer, while I finish getting my degree.

			Ultimately I am aiming for a career with a company called <a href="http://www.planetaryresources.com" style="display: inline;">Planetary Resources</a> (or <a href="http://deepspaceindustries.com/" style="display: inline;">something</a> with similar, extra-planetary, goals). I look forward to spending many years as a code monkey and system analyst in the meantime.
