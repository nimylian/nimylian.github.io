						<p>Ever since the first time I read about DevBootCamp I knew it was something different than I had ever seen. I have spent my career working in an industry that prefers the stick to the carrot, and punishment to coaching. I've never quite fit in, though I've grown very good at avoiding sticks. Whenever I have had a managerial role I've tried to implement philosophies similar to those I've seen at DevBootCamp, but they were always met with dissatisfaction from my superiors. When I read that the Chicago DBC was coming, I immediately began preparing for my exodus.</p>
						<p>The more I read and listen to members of DBC, the more certain I became that this is the organization that I have been waiting my whole life for. I will have the added challenge of driving into the city every day, from Plainfield, but for the first time in my life, the idea of waking up at 5 o'clock isn't terrifying. From the suggestion of writing the email, "I'm going to learn to be like Neo," to hearing about how they are training our bodies as well as our minds, I haven't been able to think stop thinking about the day that I would begin.</p>
						<p>All of my excitement and eagerness to begin is thinly covering my fear regarding this experience. If it wasn't for all of the support and camaraderie that I've already felt I don't know that I would've gone forward with my decision. Every aspect of DevBootCamp feels like I'm slipping into a perfectly tailored, and well-worn, suit that I've never seen before.</p>
						<p>While I recognize that at the end of Phase 3, most people are exhausted and want nothing more than to settle into a new career, I can't help but think that I will miss it. I've already grown nostalgic. Here's to hoping for Phase 4.</p></td>
