				<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
			</div>
			<article>
				<p>When I began researching Stereotype Threat, I didn't think it applied to me. I've always been told that as a middle-class, heterosexual, white male: everything is slanted in my favor, I am essentially "The Man"(who can oppress at his whim) and as a result I don't deserve any personalized help. While some of this may be true, I realized that I do fall into a stereotyped category. I am a nerd. I always have been, and with any luck I always will be. If ever you question the validity of that statement, just misquote a popular science fiction film in front of me, or mis-explain conditional logic, and you will see.</p>
				<p>Once I began looking at this issue through the lens of "the outsider" I realized how often Stereotype Threat has held me back. I've never been particularly social, and will actively avoid large groups. I struggle to identify with the interests of my peers (I will never understand spending the day watching millionaires play a game). In the end I protected myself from the ostracization of others by finding solace in my intellectual superiority.</p>
				<p>Now I've come to a new dilemma. The paradigm of my life is changing. No longer will my days be spent struggling to understand the nuances of inane conversations. Now I'm going to spend my days with people that are much more like me than ever before. I'm going to be surrounded by intelligent, and often times down right brilliant, people. The one thing that I used to protect my feelings is going to be obsolete.</p>
				<p>In addition to that, I am significantly older than the average person in my cohort. With that comes the added pressure of, "Can I keep up with these young and energetic people?" After much introspection, the answer is a resounding "Yes!" One thing I do have to shore up these weaknesses is that I have the experience and mindfulness to see how these things are affecting my performance. If nothing else, I am painfully self-aware. After having watched Claude Steele speak at Columbia University, I've learned that Stereotype Threat's effect is nothing but a red herring. It is no more real than the stereotypes themselves. In the end, the feelings of inadequacy that I may feel because of my age or social rank are irrelevant to my potential.</p>
				<p>I'm quite grateful to this DBC challenge, because it is yet another way for me to see myself and evaluate life. It is another thing to be mindful of. I will make it an ongoing part of development to keep a watchful eye on Stereotype Threat in myself and in others. I hope to be able to provide anyone with a sense of inclusiveness and safety.</p>
